      The following lines of code handle selecting a date and highlighting the selected date.
      This is an example of directly manipulating the DOM with jQuery. The $() function
      is a jQuery function for grabbing DOM elements by their class values. The
      .removeClass and .addClass methods remove or add a class value to the DOM element,
      which is styled by CSS. The styling for the 'select-highlight' class can be found
      in this module's .css file, which can be found in client/css/calendar.css. (Note that this
      .css file is loaded into the web page automatically by /config/assets/default.js)

      Directly manipulating the DOM in this way is not generally recommended when working with
      Angular.js. The preferred way would be to handle DOM manipulation in a directive, rather
      than here in the controller. However, in this case, the Angular UI calendar directive doesn't
      have this built in and I would prefer to keep my own changes in this module, rather than
      editing a third-party directive or library.

      We could just create a new event like the newEvent object below, using fullcalendar
      format. However, this wouldn't allow us to take advantage of Angular.js
      $resource functionality. So instead, we'll create a resource object. You can
      experiment with using this object instead of the newEvent resource object below.
      You'll see that it will still work fine for the UI calendar, but the $save()
      method won't be defined for it, so it won't be able to be saved to
      the database so simply (you'd have to set up the necesssary http POST or

      Instead of the above, we'll let our service create a $resource object and
      then give it all the attributes that will make it a valid fullcalendar
      event object. Check out the CalendarService() Angular service to see
      how this is created, which you'll find in /client/services/calendar.client.service.js
